📌 Project Title

Git & GitHub Guide — Learn, Practice, and Showcase Version Control

🧠 Overview

This project is a comprehensive learning website created to simplify and summarize the most critical aspects of Git and GitHub for students, developers, and professionals. It is designed as both a revision tool and a portfolio project, demonstrating fundamental and advanced Git workflows, essential commands, GitHub collaboration techniques, and open-source contribution strategies — all presented in a clear and navigable format.

The project also highlights real-world workflows (Git Flow and GitHub Flow), teaching how modern teams work collaboratively using Git and GitHub tools.

✨ Key Objectives

• Master Git commands from beginner to advanced
• Understand file lifecycle and change tracking
• Learn GitHub collaboration and contribution workflows

• Build a professional GitHub profile with a live demo

🛠️ Technologies Used

• HTML5 – For content structure and semantic layout
• CSS3 – For clean and modern styling (responsive and animated)
• JavaScript – Smooth navigation and user experience enhancements
• Git – Local version control demonstration
• GitHub – Remote repo usage, branching, forking, PR, contribution
• Python (FPDF) – For generating project documentation in PDF format
